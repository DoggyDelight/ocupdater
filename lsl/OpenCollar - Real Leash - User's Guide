Open Collar - Real Leash - User's Guide
========================

Real Leash is an OpenCollar add-on that automatically sets a number of restrictions on your collar when you are leashed. This makes the experience more real because you won't be able to teleport, sit on far away objects, or touch anything that's not close to you.

This add-on requires RLV to work properly.

Installation
-------------

Edit your collar and drag the script and this help notecard into its contents. That's all you need to do.

Usage
-------

To enable Real Leash, call up the Open Collar menu, click on "AddOns" and then "Real Leash". Click on the *Switch On* button to enable the add-on.

Once enabled, you can set a number of restrictions that will be applied to the wearer, while they are leashed to a post or another person. All settings are saved and will be restored even after a collar reset.

As soon as the wearer is leashed, the list of restrictions is hidden for them. The wearer also can't switch off Real Leash while they are leashed. Other people can still access the full menu.
